## Introduction

Hi there I'm Anand Kumar, and I work as a Game Programmer.This website is a space where I can showcase my work, share my thoughts and ideas, and connect with others who share similar interests.

I specialize in creating gameplay mechanics, AI, user interfaces, and multiplayer networking. With a deep understanding of game engine development, I build custom tools to streamline development and optimize performance. I also collaborate effectively with artists for graphics development to bring game worlds to life.

When I'm not at work you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors or playing sports. Additionally I'm a an avid gamer as well, always looking for new games to play. 

If you're a fellow game developer, a potential employer, or just someone who loves gaming, I invite you to take a look at my portfolio and see what I'm all about. Thanks for stopping by!
