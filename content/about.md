## 👋 Introduction

Hi, I'm **Anand Kumar** — a programmer passionate about creating systems that perform, scale, and engage.

My journey began in **game development**, where I focused on gameplay mechanics, AI, multiplayer networking, UI systems, and engine-level optimization. Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects across Unity and Unreal Engine, developing tools to support creative teams and pushing real-time performance boundaries.

As my interests grew, I found myself diving deeper into **backend engineering** and **systems programming**. I now enjoy working on backend services, distributed architectures, APIs, databases, and infrastructure. Whether it's crafting a compelling in-game system or a scalable backend service, I bring the same mindset: write clean, efficient code that serves people and scales reliably.

I believe that understanding both low-level systems and high-level user experiences makes me a better developer—and a better teammate.
