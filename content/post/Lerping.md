## What is Lerping?

Lerp, or Linear Interpolation, is a mathematical function in Unity that returns a value between two others at a point on a linear scale.

Most commonly itâ€™s used for moving or changing values over a period of time.

So when you are doing "Linear Interpolation" you are Linearly inserting a new point between 2 points. Linear Interpolation is inserting a new point between 2 points on a straight line.

```
float a = 10;
float b = 50;
float t = 1;

lerpValue = Mathf.Lerp(a, b, t);

// Returns 50
```

## Use Cases

A common use for Lerp is to produce an effect over a fixed period of time.

For example, to animate a button, fade the screen to black or move an object to a new position in a fixed amount of time.

## Is it worth it?

For writing simple scripts lerp is useful. Otherwise I would recommend to buy assets such as Dot Tween which has more features.
