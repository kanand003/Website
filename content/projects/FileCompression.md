File compression is a technique used to reduce the size of a file by encoding its data in a more efficient way. This is done to save storage space and improve transmission speed. There are various compression algorithms available, such as ZIP, GZIP, and BZIP2, which can be used to compress different types of files. Compressed files need to be decompressed before they can be used again.
