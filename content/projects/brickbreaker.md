## Implementation Details

### Game Architecture
The game follows a component-based architecture with these main systems:
- Game Loop Manager: Handles the core game loop, updates, and rendering
- Physics System: Manages collision detection and response
- Input Handler: Processes keyboard input for paddle control
- Resource Manager: Loads and manages game assets
- Renderer: Handles all OpenGL rendering operations

### Physics Implementation
The game uses a simplified physics system that includes:
- Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection
- Velocity-based ball movement
- Paddle reflection angles based on hit position
- Brick destruction mechanics

### Rendering System
Built using modern OpenGL features:
- Shader-based rendering pipeline
- Texture mapping for game objects
- Sprite batch rendering for performance
- Basic lighting and particle effects

## Technical Challenges

1. **Collision Detection Optimization**
   - Implementing efficient collision checks between ball and game objects
   - Handling edge cases in collision response
   - Ensuring consistent physics behavior

2. **Performance Optimization**
