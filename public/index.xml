      <description>What is Serialization? Serialization is the process of converting a data object which is a combination of code and data into a series of bytes which is saved as transmissible object. The data can then be transferred to another destination.&#xA;Why do we need to Serialize? Serialization enables us to save the state of an object and recreate the object in a new location.Serialization encompasses both the storage of the object and exchange of data.</description>

      <description>Caching What is Caching? A cache is a high speed data storage which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.&#xA;How does Caching work? The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component.</description>

      <description>What is Lerping? Lerp, or Linear Interpolation, is a mathematical function in Unity that returns a value between two others at a point on a linear scale.&#xA;Most commonly it’s used for moving or changing values over a period of time.&#xA;So when you are doing &amp;ldquo;Linear Interpolation&amp;rdquo; you are Linearly inserting a new point between 2 points. Linear Interpolation is inserting a new point between 2 points on a straight line.</description>
