      <description>Caching What is Caching? A cache is a high speed data storage which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.&#xA;How does Caching work? The data in a cache is generally stored in fast access hardware such as RAM (Random-access memory) and may also be used in correlation with a software component.</description>
